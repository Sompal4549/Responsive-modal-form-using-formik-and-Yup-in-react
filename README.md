# Responsive-modal-form-using-formik-and-Yup-in-react
Responsive modal form using [formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) package, my experience was amazing using this, package is very helpful to create a validating form with no extra react hooks it's amazing. Please let me know if need help in using this package

Clone the repository in your pc at your favorite folder and wait it to clone.
Do the npm install and your Responsive modal form is ready type the details in the form and check the console you would see and object filled with details you mentioned in the form 
You don't  need to add validation too, it's already there and it's modal too
